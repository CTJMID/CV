# ***Christopher Middleton***

An ambitious full-stack developer combining adept skills in software engineering, and considerable experience of business development, ownership, operations and management gained through a 12-year career in hospitality. 

Software engineering balances rigourous logic and analytical problem solving with lateral thinking and creativity. This mirrors my formal education in law, philosophy and fine art; culminating in my recent graduation from the Makers Academy. 

I am a looking for a role where I can develop my entrepreneurial skills in business growth and my experience managing and developing teams and people, whilst meeting commercial and social challenges with digital solutions.

The shift to a digital world should not be a compromise between 'old' and 'new'; rather it should be overwhelmingly positive and I look forward to being involved in an organisation that can help make this happen.

## **Work Experience**

### **Mitchells & Butler - The Goat, Clapham (July 2019 to December 2021)**
**General Manager**

I led operations & development of the business to deliver on metrics in profit & growth, team satisfaction, customer satisfaction, and health & safety:



- ***Profit & Growth:*** I delivered budget, despite the challenges the business faced by the pandemic, and oversaw a 5% turnover growth (and volume growth), in my last quarter. Key to this was the organisation & implementation of events and key sporting dates, e.g. The Goat was 2nd in the brand, in £'s and % growth for the Euro's 2021 competition (versus the same period in FY19)

 
- ***Team Satisfaction:*** I increased the overall engagement metric, from 52% to 83% during my tenure, by prioritising in-house development and cross-training, as well as, recruiting affectively to support the team as the business rebounded.
 

- ***Customer Satisfaction:*** NPS increased from 35% to 81% during my tenure. The Goat's online review score from 3.9/5 to 4.8/5, in the last quarter of my employment, and I maintained a 'nil' official complaint rating.

 
- ***Health & Safety:*** during my tenure, I achieved and maintained the highest possible 5;5 audit rating, and complemented this with a 5* EHO food rating.

 
These management skills are transferable to the tech industry; I have demonstrated my ability to affectively manage businesses and teams on a range of measures - something I wish to continue in my new career as I progress from Junior Developer to more senior positions.

### **Managing Director** 
#### **Fowlmere Pubs Ltd - The Chequers, Fowlmere (April 2017 to May 2019)**

 

As the sole company director:

- I negotiated purchase of the lease for my business venue, dealt with financiers, creditors and oversaw a budgeted renovation in order to establish my business.
- I developed my business by overseeing all operations, including recruitment, product, people development, marketing and customer relations, resulting annual profit in my second year.
- I sold my business for at 120% of the purchase price, making considerable profit.


 

My skills in analytical problem solving, innovation, delegation, team development and leadership were put to the test; it was essential that I used these, and improved upon them with an adaptable and resilient approach, in order to operate and grow the business.

 <br />

### **General Manager/ Multi-site Manager**
#### **The Three Tuns, Ashwell (August 2013 - April 2019)**


 
My time at The Three Tuns consolidated my introductory experience to management and business operations.

Skills that were improved during this time included:

- recruitment, team & people development

- human resources

- customer service

- entrepreneurialism, marketing & market relations

- delegation, communication & business organisation


These skills were developed further when the company expanded to a multi-site operation and I was offered a position overseeing all sites simultaneously.

<br />

## **Voluntary Consultancy Projects**
#### **Black Cap Community Committee - 2021**
I advised the grass-roots 'Black Cap Community Committee' - a group attempting to aquire, open and run a legendary queer venue in Camden.  

Specifically, I wrote a detailed report on how to structure a business plan specifically for the Black Cap, and a separate report on venue acquistion, drawing on the experince of owning my own business, and constructing business plans for The Goat.

#### **Greene King - various venues -  2014-2016**
I shadowed my mentor, over a 2 year period, whilst he conducted on-demand consultancy work for Greene King's leasehold portfolio in North Hertfordshire. This provided me invaluable experience into operations and management, but overall, I most enjoyed discussing business challenges and troubleshooting solutions with external operators.

## **Skills**


### *Analytical Problem Solving*

As manager of The Goat during Covid-19, it was my responsibility to solve new and complex challenges that arose while operating in changing conditions. Breaking down the challenges, gaining differing perspectives, remaining adaptable and reflecting on the outcome was essential to our eventual success during this period of trade.

The introduction of table service was one adaption I implemented at speed which ultimately improved our customer satisfaction scores and increased sales and tips. In an industry in decline, we increased our KPIs and became brand leaders for several weeks.

I’ve been able to adopt the same solution-focused and experimental approach to code with success. A key example of this was when we were asked to convert our vanilla JavaScript app to a MERN stack app, on our 2nd Engineering Project during the Maker's course.


 <br />

### *Entrepreneurial Mindset*

I have a keen innovative entrepreneurial streak demonstrated by my career in hospitality. My own site was a country pub in Cambridgeshire. I made it a priority to identify my key markets, elicit feedback and deliver over-an-above on their needs.

With a mix of events and product tailoring, I established a loyal customer base that helped me grow my business; 'Pie Nights', 'Charity Curry Cook-offs' & 'Kids Film Evenings' were all ideas that were generated in collaboration with my team and my key customer demographics.

 <br />

### *Team Development*

I am a people-orientated person and a natural leader; recruiting and developing a group of individuals into a functioning team has always been highlight of my role.

To develop diverse groups into functioning teams, I have had to manage on an individual basis, emphasising and encouraging employees to develop their strengths and value to the other team members.

Teams function optimally when a mutual level of respect and acknowledgement of value runs through them between individuals. The greatest successes in my career have resulted from teams that I have helped mould to this point, explified by my team at The Chequers, and the team at The Goat.

 <br />

### *People Development*

Managing individuals on a mentor/mentee basis has been invaluable to my development and I look to establish those relationships at all stages of my career.

I find the mentor role forces you to develop your own working styles and skills, as well as guiding and coaching your mentee.

For example, my most recent mentee, helped me understand different ways of working, and alternative ways that people absorb concepts and ideas. In turn, as a product of our developmental relationship I helped him achieve his ambition of securing an Assistant Manager position within our company.

## Hobbies

Food, films and dogs encapsulate my interests pretty neatly. I love finding new restaurants or staying in a cooking extravagant meals for friends. I love cinema and the art of film, really delving deep into the history and process of making films. And I love my dog, he takes up a big part of my life, but my life has been better for it!
