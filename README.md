Chris Middleton

A full-stack developer combining of newly adpet skills in software engineering, and considerable experience of small business development, operations and management gained through a 12 year career in hospitality. I am excited by the scope of the posisblities within the tech world, and how it could be used in combination with other industries not only for commercial gains, but also for the betterment of social and environmental issues.

## Work Experience

Mitchells & Butler - The Goat, Clapham (July 2019 to December 2021)  
General Manager

In this role, I had to oversee all oparteions of the business, and develop the business in order to meet expected metrics in profit & growth, team satisfaction, customer satisfcation, and health & saftey.

- In profit & growth, I manged to deliver budget, despite the restrictions and barriers that Covid presented, and oversaw a 5% turnover growth, as well as volume growth, in my last quater. The Goat took £1.3M in takings per/annum. Key to tjis was the organisation & implemnetation of events and key sporting dates. For example, The Goat was 2nd in the brand (of about 120 venues), in £'s and % uplift for the Euro's 2021 competition (verses the same period in FY19)
- In team satisfaction, I increased the overall engagemnet metric, from 52% to 83% during my tenure at The Goat. I prioritied in house development and cross-training in order to combat the post-pandemic/Brexit recruitment crisis seen within the industry, and I recruited thoughtfully and affectively to support the team as the business rebounded and grew.
- In customer satisfaction, I incrreased NPS from 35% to 81% during my tenure. I increased The Goat's online review score from 3.9/5 to 4.8/5, in the last quater of my employment, and I maintained a 'nil' official complaint rating.
- In health & saftey, during my entire course of employment, I acheived the highest possible 5;5 audit rating, and complemented this with a 5* EHO food rating.

Whilst these acheivments are closely linked to the operations of the Hospitality PLS I was employed by at the time, they demonstrate my ability to manage businesses and teams affacetivley and safley - something I wish to continue in my new career as a junior developer.

Fowlmere Pubs Ltd - The Chequers, Fowlmere (April 2017 to May 2019)  
Managing Director

I took on my own site, as the sole compoany director, in the Spring of 2017. During this time, I established, developed and eventually sold my business, for a considerable profit.

During this time, my skills anakysitiucal problem solving, entropanerialism, delegation, team builsing and leadership were pit to the test, and it was essential that I used these, and improved upon this with an adaptable resilient approach, in order to operate and grow the business.

My efforts were successful, and my business was sold for 120% of what I purchased it, whilst also generating profit on a monthly basis.

The Three Tuns, Ashwell (August 2013 - April 2019)
General Manager - Multi-site Manager

My time at The Three Tuns cemeted my introductory experince to hospitality managment and bsuiness operations. 
Personal managemnet skills that were improved during this time included:
- recruitment, team & people development
- human resources 
- customer service
- entrepreneurialism, marketing & market relations
- delegation, communication & business organisation

These skills were developed further when the company expanded to a multi-site op[efration and I was offered a postion overseeing all sites simultaneously.


## Skills

Analystical Problem Solving
From my years in formal eductaion to my years working in the hospitality managment & operations, I have used my strong anylitical skills to prempt, break-down, solve and safe-gaurd my business from arsing issues.
The impact of the changable Covid regulations on the operations of my site during 2020 and 2021 gave me an opportunity analytically breakdown these changes to our working day and creatively find processes to address them. The introduction  of table service, in a site with a team that had not previously worked this way, gave me an opportunity to not only improve the customer experience, but also train the team in a new on-the-job skill, and increase salesmanship within individuals. This was reflected in our improved customer satisfaction scores, the increased gratuities for the team, and the growth in site sales during this time. Druing the time that restrictions were in place, whilst the industry was in decline, we increased our KPIs, and delivered growth, leading the brand for a number of weeks.

Entrepreneurial Business Growth
I have a keen ideas based and entrepreneurial streak that has run through my career in hospitality. My own site was a country pub in Cambridgshire and I  amde it a priority to indentify my key markets. With a mix of events and product tailoring, I established a loyal customer base that helped me develop my business. 'Pie Nights', 'Charity Curry Cook-offs' & 'Kids Film Evenings' were all ideas that were generated in collaboration with my key customer demographics, and by listening to their feedback, I was able to run my business profitably, where previous operators had failed.

Team Development
I am a very people orientated person & a natural leader, and recruiting and developing a group of individuals into a team is always a highlight of my job. The challenges of developing a group of individulas into a team, has always been one of communication, empathy and percieved value. Working in hosiptality, you work with a wide variety of people, with different expectaions, needs and wants from their job. In order to develop diverse groups into a team, you have to manage on an individual basis, encourage individuals to display their strengths, and value to the other team members. This can take time, but it isnt until all individuals respect the value of the members in it, before the team can function properly.
