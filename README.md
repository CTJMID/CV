An ambitious & entrepreneurial full-stack developer combining newly adept skills in software engineering, and considerable experience of business development, operations and management gained through a 12-year career in hospitality. 

I am excited by the possibilities and opportunities within the digital world, and my time at Makers has only encouraged my drive and curiosity in this sector.

## **Work Experience**

### **Mitchells & Butler - The Goat, Clapham (July 2019 to December 2021)**
**General Manager**

I led operations & development of the business to deliver on metrics in profit & growth, team satisfaction, customer satisfaction, and health & safety:

 <br />

- *Profit & Growth:* I delivered budget, despite the challenges that the pandemic presented, and oversaw a 5% turnover growth, as well as volume growth, in my last quarter. Key to this was the organisation & implementation of events and key sporting dates, e.g. The Goat was 2nd in the brand, in Â£'s and % growth for the Euro's 2021 competition (versus the same period in FY19)

<br />
 
- *Team Satisfaction:* I increased the overall engagement metric, from 52% to 83% during my tenure, by prioritising in-house development and cross-training, as well as, recruiting thoughtfully and affectively to support the team as the business rebounded.
 
<br />

- *Customer Satisfaction:* NPS increased from 35% to 81% during my tenure. The Goat's online review score from 3.9/5 to 4.8/5, in the last quarter of my employment, and I maintained a 'nil' official complaint rating.

<br />
 
- *Health & Safety:* during my tenure, I achieved the highest possible 5;5 audit rating, and complemented this with a 5* EHO food rating.

<br />
 
These management skills are transferable to the Tech Industry. I have demonstrated my ability to affectively manage businesses and teams on a range of measures - something I wish to continue in my new career as I progress from Junior Developer to more senior positions.

 <br />

### **Managing Director** 
#### **Fowlmere Pubs Ltd - The Chequers, Fowlmere (April 2017 to May 2019)**

 

As the sole company director:

- negotiated purchase of the lease for my business venue, dealt with finaceers, and creditors and oversaw a budgeted renovation in order to establish my buisness
- developed my business at my site by overseeing all operations, including recruitment, people development, marketing and customer relations, resulting in monthly agrregate profit.
- sold my business lease for 120% of the purchase price, making considerable profit.

 

My skills in analytical problem solving, innovation, delegation, team development and leadership were put to the test; it was essential that I used these, and improved upon them with an adaptable and resilient approach, in order to operate and grow the business.

 <br />

### **General Manager/ Multi-site Manager**
#### **The Three Tuns, Ashwell (August 2013 - April 2019)**


 
My time at The Three Tuns consolidated my introductory experience to management and business operations.

Skills that were improved during this time included:

- recruitment, team & people development

- human resources

- customer service

- entrepreneurialism, marketing & market relations

- delegation, communication & business organisation


These skills were developed further when the company expanded to a multi-site operation and I was offered a position overseeing all sites simultaneously.

<br />


## **Skills**


### *Analytical Problem Solving*

The impact of changeable Covid-regulations on my business at The Goat put my analytical skills to the test; a careful problem-solving approach was required to balance these regulatory conditions, and meet the expectations of the business.

Breaking down the challenges, gaining differing perspectives, remaining adaptable and reflecting on the outcome was essential to our eventual success during this period of trade.

The introduction of table service to team that had not previously worked this way, gave me an opportunity to not only improve the customer experience, but also develop the team in a new on-the-job skill, and encourage salesmanship within individuals. This was reflected in our improved customer satisfaction scores, the increased gratuities for the team, and the growth in site sales during this time. During the time that restrictions were in place, whilst the industry was in decline, we increased our KPIs, and delivered growth, leading the brand for several weeks.


 <br />

### *Entrepreneurial Business Growth*

I have a keen innovative entrepreneurial streak demonstrated by my career in hospitality. My own site was a country pub in Cambridgeshire. I made it a priority to identify my key markets, elicit feedback and deliver over-an-above on their needs.

With a mix of events and product tailoring, I established a loyal customer base that helped me develop my business. 'Pie Nights', 'Charity Curry Cook-offs' & 'Kids Film Evenings' were all ideas that were generated in collaboration with my team and my key customer demographics.

 <br />

### *Team Development*

I am a people-orientated person & a natural leader; recruiting and developing a group of individuals into a functioning team has always been highlight of my role.

To develop diverse groups into functioning teams, I have had to manage on an individual basis, emphasising and encouraging employees to develop their strengths and value to the other team members.

Teams function optimally when a mutual level of respect and acknowledgement of value runs through them between individuals. The greatest successes in my career have resulted from teams that I have helped mould to this point.

 <br />

### *People Development*

Managing individuals on a mentor/mentee basis has been invaluable to my development and I look to establish those relationships at all stages of my career.

I find the mentor role forces you to develop your own working styles and skills, as well as guiding and coaching your mentee.

For example, my most recent mentee, in my previous role, helped me understand different ways of working, and alternative ways that people absorb concepts and ideas. In turn, as a product of our developmental relationship I helped him achieve his ambition of securing an Assistant Manager position within our company.

## Hobbies

 

Food, films and dogs encapsulate my interests pretty neatly. I love finding new restaurants or staying in a cooking extravagant meals for friends. I love cinema and the art of film, really delving deep into the history and process of making films. And I love my dog, he takes up a big part of my life, by my life has been better for it!
